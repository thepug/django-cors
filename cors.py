From https://github.com/acdha/django-sugar/blob/master/sugar/middleware/cors.py

Middleware that serves up representations with a CORS header to
allow third parties to use your web api from JavaScript without
requiring them to proxy it.

See: http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/

Installation
------------

1. Add to ``settings.MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES``::

'sugar.middleware.cors.CORSMiddleware',

2. Optionally, configure ``settings.CORS_PATHS`` if the default settings
aren't appropriate for your application. ``CORS_PATHS`` should be a
list of (path, content_types, headers) values where content_types and
headers are lists of mime types and (key, value) pairs, respectively.

Processing occurs first to last so you should order ``CORS_PATHS``
items from most to least specific.

See ``DEFAULT_CORS_PATHS`` for an example.

Notes
-----

* Although not officially a feature, the headers are not restricted to
the CORS spec and could conceivably include other values such as
desired (allowing, for example, custom ``Cache-Control`` settings).
